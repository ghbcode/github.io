I was not able to add files to the repository and this is what I did:

1. pulled the master branch
2. right clicked in the 'Working Tree' item in the 'git repositories' window -> import project
3. I selected 'import as a general project' and below those options there was a folder structure for 'Working Tree'
4. once you click on finish, note that a .project file appears inside the 'Working Tree' folder
