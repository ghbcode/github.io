### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional almost finished with my Master's degree in Financial Engineering. My interests are varied although they often lie in the areas of Math and Science. When I'm not working or hanging out taking care of my daughter I work on many projects including (mostly) lots of home improvement, welding, building things, some carpentry, 3D printing and the occasional arduino yun project. I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics. This is a work in progress so there will surely be changes along the way.
