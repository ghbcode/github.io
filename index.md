### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional earning my Master's degree in Financial Engineering. My interest are varied although they mostly lie in the realms of Math and Science. I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics so that I can refer back to them when I have any questions or doubts. This is a work in progress so there will surely be many changes.
