### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional almost finished with my Master's degree in Financial Engineering from **USC**. My interests are varied although they often lie in the areas of Math and Science. When I'm not working or taking care of my daughter I work on many projects including lots of home repair, some welding, carpentry, a sprinkle of 3D printing and the ocasional arduino yun project (although I would love to have more time for these). I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics. This is a work in progress so there will surely be changes along the way.
