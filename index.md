### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional earning a Master's degree in Financial Engineering from USC. My interests are varied although they often lie in the areas of Math and Science. When I'm not working or taking care of my daughter I work on many projects including lots of home repair, some welding, carpentry, a sprinkle of 3D printing and the ocasional arduino yun project (although I would love to have more time for these). I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics. This is a work in progress so there will surely be changes along the way.
