    "<br><br>\n",
    "Support vector machine models can be used for classification, regression and detecting outliers.  In practice though, SVMs are mostly used for classification purposes. SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates two classes. Generally 'best separates' means that SVM finds the hyperplane that is as equi-distant from each class as possible. In the picture below from wikipedia this 'maximum margin' concept is depicted.\n",

    "Note that when SVM encounters a non-separable problem it employs what is knows as the 'kernel trick'. What the kernel trick does is to take a low dimensional input space and turn it into a higher dimensional input space. In the image below the kernel trick is to change the basis function to $\\phi(a,b) = \\{a, b, a^2+b^2\\}$ so that instead of creating a hyperplane, SVM is creating a circle such that the linearly separable data in red can be correctly classified.\n",
