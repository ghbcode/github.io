# Notes on Machine Learning Topics

Each topic will be covered within a self contained python notebook.

* 15 bias â€“ variance, overfitting (variance), lebesge
* 16: midterm review so start of l2 regularization
* 17: l2 regularization
* 18: L1 regularization, promotes sparsity
* 19: L0 and Bayesian feature selection
* 20: p-norms, Bridge regression is the family of penalized regressions (where Lasso is gamma=1, ridge is gamma=2), Validation and test set with very good E_out and bounding math. AML chapter 4.3 and on has good material on this
* 21: More on Training and validation with bounding math. Adaptive basis-function models, CART (decision trees) forms a tree and a set of regions in feature space
* 22: Very thorough analysis of CART
* 23: 1st page has a very good pros/cons on CART. Random forest is an averaging over individual trees to get better results. 
  * Pseudo algorithm. 
    * Some part is a Bagging (or bootstrap aggregating) procedure. Reduces variance (see averaging function)
    * correlation of the trees is small/er and this also reduces variance
    * formulas for regression and classification provided
* 24: Boosting, another adaptive basis-function model
  * a weak learner that can classify entire feature space 
  * Objective function of AdaBoost provided
    * uses exponential loss as the base to find the argmin Lec24p5
* 25: Semi-supervised learning
  * inductive - supervised learning, i.e. learn from labeled data
  * transductive semi-supervised learning- predict the labels on the unlabeled instances of the training data.
  * Self training algo: use labeled data to find f_hat, then using f_hat label unlabeled data
  * propagating 1-NN
  * Mixture models
    * Great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REypj2sy_5U&list=PLBv09BD7ez_4e9LtmK626Evn1ion6ynrt
* 26: More mixture models and then EM (expectation maximization)
  * Great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQoXFmbXRJA&index=2&list=PLBv09BD7ez_4e9LtmK626Evn1ion6ynrt
  * Page 4 shows difficulty in mixture models and reason for EM
  * Page 5 shows use of EM (find missing data, find MLE, estimate quantities in mixture models)
  * Shows entire derivation of E and M steps
* 27: Unsupervised learning : first page has good uses 
  * data clustering or grouping (helps find features or centroids)
  * Based on similarity or dissimilarity measures
    * euclidean distance (x-y)^2, l1 norm |x-y|
    * for categorical features it can be the Hamming distance (number of features that are different between x and y
    * a couple of other measures
  * hierarchical graphical clustering 
  * aglomerative hierarchical clustering 
    * dendogram
* 28: aglomerative hierarchical clustering 
  * useful measures
  * NN algorithm
  * Farthest Neighbor algorithm


## MISC
Source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function
> For example, some likelihood functions are for the parameters that explain a collection of statistically independent observations. In such a situation, the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions. The logarithm of this product is a sum of individual logarithms, and the derivative of a sum of terms is often easier to compute than the derivative of a product.
